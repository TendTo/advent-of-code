# Advent of code

Repository for the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

It is an yearly challenge where you have to solve a puzzle every day from the 1st to the 25th of December.  
Its author is [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

## Expected input-output

By default the input for each puzzle is read from an `input.txt` and the output is written to an `output.txt` file.
Both files will need to be in the current working directory.
Keep in mind that this will overwrite the file if it already exists.
