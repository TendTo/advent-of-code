# Advent of code

Repository for the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

It is an yearly challenge where you have to solve a puzzle every day from the 1st to the 25th of December.  
Its author is [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

## Expected input-output

By default the input for each puzzle is read from tge standard input and the output is written to the standard output.
Furthermore, both parts of each puzzle will be run.  
The scripts allows for customization of this behaviour by passing the input and output file names as arguments and by passing the part number as an argument.
Use the `-h` flag to see the available options.
